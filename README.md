Simple game that runs on the browser console. Made to put into practice JavaScript

The  main skill put into practice in this project was JavaScript. Here is a list of
a breakdown of smaller, more varied skills:

1) Problem solving
2) Pseudocode
3) Variables
4) Loops
5) Functions
6) Scope
7) Debugging

The first step was to come up with a game plan and break down this problem into smaller problems.
I used pseudocode to outline my project, and as I went on, I outlined more problems.

Once the script was written, I went back and refined the code by seperating more tasks as functions.
I decided have the score exist in the global context to create seperate helper functions that could 
handle this data. I also made code as efficient as I could in this phase.
